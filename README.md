The analysis found that 237 employees had left the company, representing 16% of the total workforce. The average age of employees leaving was 37, and most of them had a life science education. The majority of employees left after one year, and the most common age range was between 25-35. The highest attrition rates were observed in the Library Technician and Sales Executive job roles. The main reason for the attrition among Library Technicians and Research Scientists could be their salary, as their average salary was found to be 3.2K. The analysis also revealed that males in the lab technician role were leaving more frequently.
